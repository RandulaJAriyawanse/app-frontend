<div class="rich-content clearfix"><h1>Cruiseco&nbsp;</h1><h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1><p>Thank you for choosing Cruiseco, a licensed and ATAS accredited travel agent.</p><p>The following Terms &amp; Conditions (‘booking conditions’) form the basis of your contract with Cruiseco (‘Cruiseco’, ‘We’, ‘Us’ or ‘Our’). Please read them carefully as they set out your and our respective rights and obligations. By asking your travel consultant (on your behalf) or yourself( if booking directly) to confirm your booking, we are entitled to assume that you have had the opportunity to read and have read these booking conditions, that you agree to them and that you agree to them applying to your travel arrangements that you book with us and which we agree to make as part of our contract with you.</p><h3><strong>Governing Law</strong></h3><p>These booking conditions are governed by the law in force in New South Wales, Australia.</p><p>These booking conditions apply to the person making the booking and all other persons on whose behalf the booking is made. The person making the booking must be at least 18 years of age and must be authorised to make the booking on behalf of all the members of the travelling party. The person making the booking must also provide a copy of these booking conditions to the other members of the party.</p><h3><strong>Intermediary</strong></h3><p>Cruiseco acts as a travel intermediary arranging travel services and sells travel related products of third-party travel suppliers (‘Suppliers’) such as airlines, cruise lines, tour operators, &amp; hotels. In doing so, Cruiseco gives no warranty nor makes any representation regarding the services to be supplied or the products purchased by you.</p><p>Our role in relation to your travel arrangements is limited to facilitating your booking and arranging travel documentation, payments and refunds as applicable.&nbsp; By providing advice and booking your holiday, Cruiseco &nbsp;has provided the service promised.</p><p>You acknowledge that you will have separate contracts with each Supplier of travel services. These separate contracts will be governed by the Suppliers’ terms &amp; conditions, and it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of these other terms &amp; conditions. Copies of these terms &amp; conditions are available upon request and can usually be found on the supplier’s website or brochure.</p><p>Your legal agreement and contract for the delivery of the booked travel services are with the Supplier.&nbsp; You agree that if the travel services or products are not supplied in accordance with your booking your remedy lies with the Supplier and not with Cruiseco nor your travel consultant. &nbsp;Cruiseco accepts no liability for the Suppliers breach of contract with you.</p><p>Cruiseco will not be held liable in any way for any acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties or negligence by any suppliers. In the event of an issue arising between the traveller/s and the service supplier, we will assist by initiating contact between the parties but will not be party to ongoing communications or negotiations.</p><p>Cruiseco will immediately pass on your deposit and full payment to suppliers. Due to the extraordinary circumstances we are currently all living through, we cannot accept any responsibility for the amounts paid out on your behalf in the instance of demise of any of the Suppliers.</p><h3><strong>Reservations</strong></h3><p>Please check that all names are spelt exactly as per the passports for all travellers as some airlines, cruise lines and other suppliers do not permit name changes. Those that do permit name changes often charge significant fees.</p><p>Each itinerary is subject to change up to and during the voyage, at the Suppliers’ discretion. Cruiseco has no control over these changes, and we will notify your travel consultant when we have been advised by the Supplier.</p><h4><strong>Cruise Booking Registration</strong></h4><p>In support of being ECO FRIENDLY nearly all cruise lines require online booking registration which must be completed by the traveller before travel documents are released. Failure to do so will cause delays of documents being released 10-20 working days prior to the departure date from Australia. It is your responsibility to make sure all the necessary registration documents have been completed to avoid delays once final payment has been processed as cruise lines issue documentation in departure date sequence. In the event a paper booking form and any additional supporting forms (eg: medical clearance forms) must be completed it is important you submit the required information for the cruise line.</p><h3><strong>Cancellation Fees</strong></h3><h4><strong>Cruise Only</strong></h4><p>Cancellation after deposit payment but prior to final payment: Cruiseco will not retain any cancellation fees and will only pass on cruise line cancellation fees if applicable</p><p>Cancellation once final monies are paid; Cruiseco <a href="#_msocom_1">[NC1]</a>&nbsp; Cruising may retain a minimum fee of $50 per person.&nbsp; This charge is in addition to any cancellation fees charged by Cruise Lines.</p><h4><strong>Fly/Cruise Package</strong></h4><p>Cancellation after deposit payment but prior to final payment: Cruiseco will retain a minimum fee of $50 per person. This charge is in addition to any cancellation fees charged by Cruise Lines and/or airline/hotel/tour operator.</p><p>Cancellation once final monies are paid; Cruiseco may retain a minimum fee of $200&nbsp;per person.&nbsp; This charge is in addition to any cancellation fees charged by Cruise Lines and/or airline/hotel/tour operator.</p><p>Cancellation penalties, and terms and conditions vary with all cruise lines. Please ensure that you are aware of the conditions applicable to the cruise line that you/your clients are travelling with.</p><h4><strong>Amendments</strong></h4><p>After deposits have been received, amendments to bookings may incur a $50 per person per amendment in addition to any fees charged by suppliers. Where a cruise line releases a promotional fare after you have booked, any transfer of that booking to a promotional fare on the same or new cruise is regarded as a cancellation of the first booking and subject to cancellation penalties. Some cruise lines have strict policies regarding rebooking a cruise on promotional rates.</p><h3><strong>Flights</strong></h3><p>All airfares are subject to change / increase / withdrawal without notice by the airline(s) until paid in full and tickets issued. &nbsp;&nbsp;Please check that the flight itinerary dates, times &amp; cities are correct - please note that airline itineraries use 24-hour time. Fees apply for changes made after the tickets have been issued.</p><p>Flight schedules are subject to change without notice, and we recommend checking your flight times with the airline at least 72 hours prior to travel. Claims for costs incurred as a result of schedule changes must be made directly to the airline concerned. Cruiseco cannot be held responsible for the actions of an airline.</p><p>Some low-cost carriers have additional charges not included in the air ticket cost for luggage (particularly US domestic flights). These costs are beyond our control and cannot be pre-paid to us as ticketing agents for the airline. Many airline carriers now charge for all baggage, meals and inflight entertainment on international flights. These fees and charges CANNOT be collected by the agent in advance. Each carrier and route has variations on prices and requirements. Please ask your travel consultant for a breakdown of applicable pay direct fees applicable to your booking or check with the airline by managing the booking online via the airline’s website.</p><p>We recommend contacting the airlines directly for your seating and special meal requests to ensure that the airline has accurately noted your requirements. Airlines will often advise seat numbers but will not guarantee your seating until final boarding. Passengers are responsible for reconfirming all flights 72 hours prior to flight departure times.</p><h4><strong>Frequent Flyer Points</strong></h4><p>It is your responsibility to notify us if you are a member of an airline frequent flyer program, and to acquaint yourself with the rules of that program. Some airfares are not eligible to earn points, and we are not liable if you are unable to claim frequent flyer points for this or any other reason.</p><h4><strong>PASSPORT &amp; PASSENGER INFO FOR AIR TICKETS:</strong></h4><p>To issue any international Air Tickets we will require an emailed copy of all passenger’s passports to include APIS data in the PNR prior to ticketing.</p><p>Failure to provide this data will delay ticketing and result in re-booking and possible fare increase or unavailability of preferred flights.</p><p>We also require the passenger’s mobile phone and email address for the airline. Failure to provide this information may mean the airline rejects the booking OR the passenger could miss out on essential information on their booking such as schedule changes.</p><h3><strong>Prices &amp; Payments</strong></h3><p>Prices are quoted in Australian Dollars unless advised otherwise at time of booking and include pre-paid taxes where applicable.&nbsp; Some countries charge departure taxes that must be paid locally.</p><p>Prices and quotations from Suppliers are subject to change due to fluctuations in charges, taxes &amp; currencies and peak period surcharges.</p><p>Prices are subject to change with or without notice until payment for the booking has been received in full. These price changes are not under the control of Cruiseco.</p><p>Failure to make payments by the due by date on your invoice may result in the cancellation of your booking without warning.</p><h4><strong>Exchange Rate Adjustments</strong></h4><p>Fluctuations in exchange rates are beyond our control. We reserve the right to increase any fare prices at any time without prior notice to consider exchange rate fluctuations. NOTE: Bookings paid in full are protected from increases due to currency fluctuation. Bookings can be paid in full at any time to provide protection from fare increases due to currency fluctuation.&nbsp; Any increase in taxes, levies (government, airline, body corporate) or other compulsory fees to be paid will be additional and notified as they arise.&nbsp;</p><p>Bookings which have been cancelled and paid for by Cruiseco in a currency other than AUD will be refunded based on the daily rate of exchange on the date the refund is received by us.</p><h4><strong>Port, City, Air &amp; Government Taxes</strong></h4><p>AIR TAXES: We have included an approximate cost for airport taxes within the quoted invoice for cruise-tour packages. Additional stopovers and/or deviations en-route may alter the cost of these taxes. Exact airline taxes will be determined at the time of ticket issue and surcharges may apply.</p><p>GOVERNMENT/PORT TAXES: Governed by local port authorities; port charges and govt fees are subject to currency fluctuation and are required by law to be costed separately from the cruise fare. Airline taxes are also subject to currency fluctuation; and are converted at the exchange rate(s) when final payment is made. The port charges and airline tax amounts are a guide only.</p><p>CITY/TOURISM TAXES: Please note that there can be various local taxes/surcharges applied to bookings in certain areas. These charges are payable by the guest at the conclusion/billing of the stay. These surcharges cannot be pre-paid and are not included in your invoice.</p><h4><strong>Promotional Cruise Fares</strong></h4><p>Cruise lines on occasion will advertise special promotional fares which can be released and withdrawn at any time. These fares are for NEW bookings only, therefore any existing booking cancelled to rebook on these promotional fares will be subject to the loss of deposit or cancellation fees applicable to the existing booking. Promotional fare cabins are berthed at the cruise lines discretion, and no specific cabin or berth requests will be taken. Cabin numbers will be advised at embarkation and the cruise line reserves the right to change the allocated cabin at any time.</p><h4><strong>Wholesale Cruise Fares</strong></h4><p>Wholesale/Group Cruise Fares are frequently used as part of our packages or special deals. These fares can have different booking terms to standard fares and may have different booking conditions. Please refer to your confirmation for further information.</p><p>For cancellations/suspensions where the Cruise Line is protecting commission this is generally not applicable to these fares. &nbsp;Cruiseco will not protect commission on such cancellations.</p><h4><strong>Website Errors and Omissions</strong></h4><p>Cruiseco reserves the right to cancel a booking and provide a full refund if the booking made was subject to an accidental error on the website. For example, an incorrect set of inclusions, price, departure date, cruise line or other error. In these circumstances an offer will be made for either a full refund or the best available rate for the initially requested booking.</p><h3><strong>Cabin Guarantee / Ships Option</strong></h3><p>The definition of a GUARANTEE cabin (GTY) is one where there is no cabin number assigned at the time of booking the cabin. For example, you may book a stateroom of a guaranteed category type (Inside, Oceanview, Balcony, Suite etc.) on your chosen ship and cruise, however the exact grade, cabin number or location of the stateroom on the ship will be allocated by the cruise line at any time up until check-in for boarding. Guests booked in a guarantee status cabin/s may not be berthed with other travelling parties due to availability. Cabins allocated may be subject to obstructed views. The benefits of a guarantee (GTY) cabin are reduced fares and the cruise line may (at their discretion) upgrade your cabin to one of a superior category at no extra charge. Once your guarantee (GTY) cabin has been allocated to you, the cruise line is unable to accept any cabin change requests.</p><h4><strong>Cabin Number</strong></h4><p>In many cases cruise lines will allocate passengers a cabin number at the time of booking or when your documentation is issued. This cabin number may be shown on the itinerary and also on the cruise documentation; however, this cabin number is never guaranteed by either the cruise line or Cruiseco. Passengers may be relocated within the same grade/category by the cruise line at any time up to embarkation without notice. Please refer to the cruise line brochure or the "contract of passage" supplied with your cruise documentation.</p><h3><strong>Dining Requests</strong></h3><p>Dining times are on a request basis only and are made on a first booked basis. Often the selected time will be on request only and waiting confirmation by the cruise line. Confirmation of your dining time is given by the cruise line upon embarkation of your cruise. Please refer to the cruise lines' terms and conditions in their brochure.</p><h3><strong>Gratuities</strong></h3><p>Gratuities (tipping) in the cruise industry is a customary practice to show appreciation for excellent service. Many cruises lines have mandatory gratuities. On certain cruise lines gratuities are included in the fare passage through they may not cover all services or gratuities during the cruise. Where this is not displayed by the cruise line or on any documentation we recommend as a guideline to allow between USD11.00 – USD20.00 per passenger per day.</p><h3><strong>Shore Excursions</strong></h3><p>We recommend that you pre-book your shore excursions prior to departure from Australia. Many cruise lines make their shore excursions available online prior to departure. If the cruise line offers this service, we will provide your cruise reference number so that passengers can access and book online. Cruiseco is not responsible should any shore excursions be sold out or on waitlist prior to your departure. Cruise lines can release their shore excursions online at any time, so we strongly recommend checking their website regularly, or contact the cruise line concerned for an approximate release date.</p><h3><strong>Travel Advice Notices &amp; Visas</strong></h3><p>Please check the latest travel advice issued by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade prior to your journey, visit www.smartraveller.gov.au or by calling 1300 555 135.</p><p>It is the ultimate responsibility of the traveller to ensure they are fully aware of all passport, visas/ESTA immigration and health requirements, quarantine, pre-arrival Covid testing and immunisation requirements for their destination(s) and that your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond your return date to Australia. Please ask your travel consultant or contact the relevant embassy or consulate for each country that you are visiting.</p><p>Holders of non-Australian passports may require a re-entry visa to return to Australia, and this is your responsibility to check.</p><p>It is your responsibility to advise us if you have any difficulty with obtaining passports or visas before travelling.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT COVID-19 POLICIES ON VACCINATION, TESTING AND QUARANTINE:</strong></p><p>Please note that Covid-19 policies vary across state and international borders and that individual suppliers maintain their own Covid-19 policies. All government (state, national and international) and supplier Covid-19 policies can change regularly. Suppliers such as airlines, cruise lines, hotels, tour operator and other service providers all may maintain their own policies which may vary between suppliers. It is your (the travel consultants) responsibility to ensure your client is compliant with the most up to date&nbsp;COVID-19 policy including but not limited to; vaccination,&nbsp;Covid&nbsp;testing and Quarantine requirements as they apply to each destination and supplier involved in the itinerary. Covid testing requirements at client expense may be required at multiple times prior, during and after travel. Quarantine requirements vary and may apply after arrival in a destination and upon arrival back to Australia. Any quarantine expenses incurred are the responsibility of the client. Conditions for testing and quarantine may change and non-compliance to current procedure may impact your client’s ability to travel. Proof of Covid-19 vaccination is a requirement of many suppliers and governments. The method of proving vaccination may vary and it is important to ensure your client has the correct documentation for the destinations and suppliers involved in their travel.</p><p><strong>Health &amp; Vaccinations</strong></p><p>Depending on your travel itinerary you may need vaccinations and/or medications. It is your responsibility to seek medical advice from your doctor relating to your travel.</p><h4><strong>Travel Insurance</strong></h4><p>We strongly recommend you purchase adequate travel insurance for your journey. This should be finalised at the time of paying your deposit to cover against possible cancellation/amendment fees due to unforeseen circumstances.</p><h3><strong>Force Majeure</strong></h3><p>Neither Party will be liable for any failure or delay in performing an obligation under this Agreement that is due to any of the following causes, to the extent beyond its reasonable control: acts of God, accident, riots, war, terrorist act, epidemic, pandemic, quarantine, outbreaks of infectious disease or any other public health crisis, civil commotion, breakdown of communication facilities, natural catastrophes, governmental acts or omissions, changes in laws or regulations, national strikes, fire, explosion, not limited too.</p><p><br></p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, Force Majeure shall not include (a) financial distress nor the inability of either party to make a profit or avoid a financial loss, (b) changes in market prices or conditions, or (c) a party's financial inability to perform its obligations hereunder.

Changes in policy are in line with Australian and International standards. In the event where smoking is permitted the service provider will make this public knowledge.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Check-in Times</strong></h3><p>The departure time shown on the itinerary for a cruise line, Airline or land supplier is current at time of issue. The departure time is&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;the same as the check-in time. Check-in time is as per the advice of the service supplier / provider terms and is the latest time at which they will accept a person for travel. The supplier may refuse carriage if late so it is imperative to check the time to present for boarding and check-in.</p><h3>Cabin Upgrades</h3><p>Please indicate if you want a cabin which is open for a free upgrade and we will endeavour to make your cabin as an "available for upgrade" status, however there is no guarantee that the upgrade will occur as upgrades are actioned by the cruise line and at their discretion and option. The cruise line will not give advance notice that an upgrade will be allocated nor will they accept requests for any particular cabin grade or number. The upgrade system is an automated system therefore there is no choice. Once an upgrade has been applied it cannot be reversed and you may find the upgrade cabin location is not to your liking which is why we advise to give due consideration to requesting this option.</p><h2>Hotels Suppliers and Other Services</h2><p>Descriptions and locations for accommodation and features are based on current international hotel guides and information provided by hotels or aggregator and any facilities shown as included are subject to change at any time. Hotel room photographs may not be specific to actual room occupied. As standards of accommodation, facilities and services within your arrangements are based on various factors, Cruiseco makes no specific representation with regard thereto or with respect to fitness for purpose of any that are available or provided. Reference to facilities in hotels such as gyms, spas or saunas does not imply their use is free.</p><p>Prices are based on existing bedding in the room which is provided purely as a guide and subject to hotel renovations or other circumstances out of our control. We recommend any special requests be made at the time of booking. e.g.: Twin (2 separate beds) or (a double bed) by sending Cruiseco an email. It is important to note arrangements cannot be guaranteed as hotels may have limited availability of specific bedding types including child and infant bedding. For triple share rooms the additional bed may be rollaway and any additional bedding may incur a charge payable direct to the hotel. To guarantee charges for any incidental items may require validation of a credit card upon check-in with the hotel.</p><h3>Hotel Ratings</h3><p>There are various criteria which make up a property rating. Cruiseco Packages are designed to deliver value and quality by offering 3 to 5-star hotels.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A 3-star hotel can be qualified as a standard level of accommodation, with reasonable hotel service and amenities.&nbsp;</li><li>A 4-star hotel is a superior category with well-appointed rooms and hotel facilities.</li><li>A 5-star hotel is a first to deluxe category hotel delivering service of the highest standard with a range of superior facilities.</li></ul><h3>Baggage</h3><p>The amount of checked baggage you are permitted depends on the class of travel and destination as outlines by the airline carrier. A number of leading carriers have introduced additional charges for checked baggage based on either per piece or weight basis or both. Full details of each carrier's baggage policy and any applicable fees can be found on their website or will display when making the reservation.&nbsp;</p><h3>Denied Boarding</h3><p>In most circumstances, if you are denied boarding by an airline carrier involuntarily, you are entitled to compensation. When required by applicable law, the airline carrier must solicit volunteers before anyone is denied boarding involuntarily. Check with the carrier for the complete terms on payment of denied boarding compensation and for information on the airline carrier’s boarding priorities.</p><h3>Airline Seating and Special Requests</h3><p>Flights may be overbooked and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight. Air carriers will often advise seat numbers but it is important to note it is not a guarantee until final boarding.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons making bookings online have the option to request seating and other specials requirements e.g.: meals, wheelchairs, medical conditions when available by the airline. Should any service not provide this option you can make the request to us and we will do all possible to confirm this. Passengers are responsible for confirming and checking flights and times with the airline and we recommend this be done 72 hours prior for all flight departures.</p><h3>Frequent Flyer</h3><p>It is essential to check frequent flyer number matches that on the passport as this may cause the mileage points to not generate. As a precaution we advise to keep copies of the travel itinerary and boarding passes from the trip so that the airline can assist with crediting any mileage points not generated over the course of the passenger’s travels. The airline will provide assistance regarding any redemption points missed.</p></div>
